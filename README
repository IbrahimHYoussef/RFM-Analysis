RFM 
is a method of customer segmentation where it takes into account when was the last time a customer bought from you and how many times, they bought from you and how much they spend on your product  

RFM stands for 
- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases.
